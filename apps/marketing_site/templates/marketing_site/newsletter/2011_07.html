		<img class=" article_teaser_image" src="{% media_url "images/newsletters/2011-07/turnover-60.png" %}" />
		<p>Earlier this month, the Meyer Foundation and CompassPoint released a study showing that two-thirds of the nonprofit Executive Directors they surveyed were planning on leaving their current job within five years.  Among the reasons that leaders cited for leaving were financial problems, under-performing boards, and a burdensome time commitment.  </p>
		
		<p>Those reasons aren't exactly eye-opening revelations for most that have experience in the nonprofit world.  Still, that 67% number is significant.  Turnover is a major issue that all organizations have to overcome, but its effect seems to be amplified for nonprofits, especially those with small staff size and limited resources.</p>

			<p>Turnover's biggest loss can be the relationships - that personal knowledge of donors, volunteers, and participants that leave with a former employee. This month, we released the a way to keep that information, even when turnover happens. We call it conversations.</p>

			<p>At its most basic, conversations is a log of every interaction you've had with a person.  You can specify when and how it happened, and take any notes that are relevant.  Now, if a staff member moves on, you'll still have access to the details of their interactions, and can get the new employee up to speed quickly.</p>

			<p>It's also a breath of fresh air for donors.  Instead of "Jim's moved to another job, so can you tell me what you do?", you can now say "Oh, Jim's moved on, but I'm fully up to date. Should we still expect you at our August 27 fundraiser, with a gift of 2,000?"</p>

			<div class="article_teaser">
			<img class="article_teaser_image" src="{% media_url "images/newsletters/2011-07/google-plus-50.png" %}" />
			<p>There's a new kid on the social media block, and it goes by the name of Google.  Google+, the search powerhouse's latest (and best) attempt to take on the social space has launched, and is now in the hands of a few folks with "field trial" accounts. (Full disclosure - I'm one of them) But, what in the name of tweeting, liking, and +1ing does this actually mean for nonprofits?  Let's take a look.</p>


			<p>First and foremost, there's no way yet to add your nonprofit to Google+.  Right now, they're focused on building it out for individuals, and have stated that businesses and other "non-human entities" are definitely on the way. </p>
